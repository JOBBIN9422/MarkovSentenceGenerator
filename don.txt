Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres. - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins
Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi.
@seketa77  I hope so for the charity's sake
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.

Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden? They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit. All he did is say O.K.
The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more.

I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke.

A-Rod is just not making it. We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great.
I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight. We'll all be watching @MittRomney.
Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won.
Isn't it time that Obama release his college records and applications? Boy would that create a mess! He is not who you think.

Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs?
Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate.
"If @MittRomney has a good debate tomorrow night, Obama is finished!"
Good response on jobs by @MittRomney.
Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other. At one point it looked like they would come to blows. 
Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
Verlander is great but  very beatable. Does not have a good ERA in playoff games
".@History's wonderful ""The Men Who Built America"" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate"
I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.
Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series.
Yankees can win today. Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher.

Barack Obama is not who you think he is. Most overrated politician in US history.
Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it? It's all talk.

Get ready for tonight!
Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod. Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason. 
@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you. You are doing a great job.
When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them. Loyalty is very important.
We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age.They just don't believe we would.
A record 46.68M Americans are now on food stamps http://t.co/0acwArSn  Four more years?
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
Looking forward to Sunday’s speech in the ExCel Centre. http://t.co/SV6KAS1E
If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
$30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench. @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)
"In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens. I like him again, a lot."
"Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it ""mildly"" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter."
Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices?
Glad to hear that @RobinRoberts is doing well. She is a terrific person.
My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race.
Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well.
"""You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird.""  -- @MittRomney"
So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince http://t.co/6KErqMup  Sounds like his book bio!
Greece should get out of the euro &amp; go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time.
"With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?"
"First Minister of Scotland released bomber of Pan Am flight #103 on ""compassionate grounds."" Do you believe?"

Consumer spending fell in September http://t.co/BG0U7bYz  Another indicator the 7.8% unemployment number is cooked.
Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate. Let's see how he reacts under pressure.

I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama. Be careful on Thursday night!
Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.  He is desperate.
Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner.

"27 days until America's greatest test since our founding. In this election, we decide whether we become great again."
