Joe went to the store.
Sarah and Jessie are going swimming.
The frog jumped and landed in the pond.
Can I have some juice to drink?
The pizza smells delicious.
There is a fly in the car with us.
Look on top of the refrigerator for the key.
I am out of paper for the printer.
Will you help me with the math homework?
The music is too loud for my ears.
The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.
What is your favorite color?
My favorite color is blue.
I am really hungry.
Joe fell asleep after a long day of work.
The printer is out of colored ink.
My favorite food is pizza.
